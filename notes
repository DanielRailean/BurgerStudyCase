Servers will need to share same refresh and access token keys
 to be able to server user requests no matter which server 
 the request is forwarded to 

SQlite wil be used for the ease of implementation ,
 in production should be swapped with Oracle SQLServer or 
 any other db that supports concurrency.

DBs then would be scaled horisontaly and split for ex at 10k users.

Images would be stored in a separate container / service and in Users content db only or image src would be included.
